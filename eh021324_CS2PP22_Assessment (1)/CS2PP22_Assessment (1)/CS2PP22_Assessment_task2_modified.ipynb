    "<h2 style=\"color:Crimson;\">Assessment Task 2: Twitter Data Analysis</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked by a client to analyse information from the social media platform, Twitter.  On Twitter, users can compose \"tweets\" (messages) of up to 280-characters in length that will be shared in real-time to friends and followers on the platform.  Millions of tweets are shared by millions of users every day. The client has an interest in developing a **regression-based predictive model** based on tweet characteristics to determine how many **likes** (a.k.a \"favourites\") a specific future tweet will ultimately receive. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract** a dataset of tweets.\n",
    "- Perform a simple **exploratory data analysis**.\n",
    "- **Manipulate** the data into a form suitable for regression analysis.\n",
    "    - This might involve some data cleaning.\n",
    "- **Save** this data to the `./data/Task2/` space.\n",
    "    - It is sensible to save one file per user.\n",
    "- Design and implement a **regression analysis model** based on one of the `sklearn` methods described in the module.\n",
    "- **Evaluate** your model's performance.\n",
    "- **Test** your model on a tweet that your model has not seen.\n",
    "    - You can do this with a train/test split of the collected data, collect new data for testing, or develop an alternative protocol.\n",
    "- Provide a **written report** that follows your steps along the way, including:\n",
    "    - justification of your selected analyses;\n",
    "    - analysis of the findings;\n",
    "    - descriptions of and reasoning behind your workflow design, implementation, decisions, and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations:**\n",
    "- You will need to extract **at least 300** tweets (perhaps, the 300 most recent tweets) from **at least 3** Twitter accounts.  That’s **at least 900** tweets, in total.   Typically, though, a larger dataset will yield more robust results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color:Crimson;\">Critical:</b>\n",
    "    - Tweet extraction will rely on your choice of extraction package.\n",
    "    - To extract Tweets, you will need to `pip`-install helper packages, such as:\n",
    "        - `tweepy`: https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/\n",
    "        - `twint`: https://pypi.org/project/twint/\n",
    "        - `json`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\n",
    "    - To extract Tweets with `tweepy`, you **MUST** have a Twitter developer account to access the API.\n",
    "        - Further details about these requirements are available in this notebook, below, and in the assessment description: `CS2PP22_Assessment.pdf`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- You are free to determine the predictive features of your model.  Be sure to select the appropriate **kinds** of data for this type of analysis.  You might consider:\n",
    "    - the number of mentions in a tweet\n",
    "    - the number of followers or friends of anyone mentioned\n",
    "    - the number of hashtags\n",
    "    - the number of emojis\n",
    "    - the number of words/characters\n",
    "    - the time of day, week, or year\n",
    "    - the sentiment of the words\n",
    "        - this would require the use of an additional package, like `TextBlob`: https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/\n",
    "            - `sentiment.subjectivity`\n",
    "            - `sentiment.polarity`\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the distribution of observed likes appear? \n",
    "    - Might you need to **transform** or **scale** the likes to conform to the assumptions of the model? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How should you choose users for analysis?  \n",
    "    - You might want to think about how frequently a user is active on the platform.  Less active accounts will likely provide the same number of tweets over a much longer time period than a more active account, and comparing these would mean comparing very different periods in time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- How should tweets be selected for analysis?\n",
    "    - It typically takes some amount of time for a tweets number of likes to plateau.  You might wish to ignore more recent tweets and focus on those that have \"matured.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- How should the data be visualised in the various parts of this Task?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Report format:**\n",
    "    - Use **markdown headings** to denote report sections and subsections.\n",
    "    - Use the notebook **markdown cells** to describe work done in the code cells and their outputs (e.g., properly labeled figures).  Markdown entries should describe features of (at most, a few) immediately preceding cells and any imported routines.\n",
    "    - Use concise, descriptive language to fully explain your methods and results.\n",
    "    - Refer to the **Assessment** section on Blackboard to review resources for support and guidance on clear communication.\n",
    "    - All code should be accompanied by concise, descriptive **comments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exceptional reports** will include deeper analysis.  For instance, you might consider comparing models trained for individual users versus a multi-user training set and testing such models on other users.  You might also investigate other `sklearn` regression techniques and analyse differences in their behaviours and performance.  Exceptional reports will also likely include novel model feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completion will require that you write Python code to perform each of the sub-tasks of the Task2 work.\n",
    "    - Try to follow the PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008\n",
    "    - Function and variable annotations are not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some parts of this assignment may require further self-study of Python documentations or other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may also refer to other documentation/self-study resources, such as those suggested in the Lecture Notes or a multitude of other resources that you have independently discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Items to be submitted:**\n",
    "1. A modified version of this Jupyter notebook file (`.ipynb`)\n",
    "    - This should be fully executed in a serial fashion, from top to bottom.\n",
    "    - Try **Kernel** --> **Restart & Run All** to verify that this works as intended.\n",
    "    - Add a cell at the top of the notebook to note the installation method and version of any additional Python packages not included in the module's Anaconda distribution or that was not instructed to be installed during the module.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Files containing the **Twitter data** used in your analysis.  These should be:\n",
    "    - stored under `./data/Task2/` in your archived submission;\n",
    "    - and separated by your selected Twitter users.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. A copy of this notebook (**with the `CS2PP22_Assessment_Task2` label** as in Item 1.) but in `.pdf` format, which displays all content independently.  This can be included in the overall assessment archive, but an unarchived copy should be submitted to Blackboard alongside the archive.\n",

    "i scaled the values using log scale so that the range values are not too high, The provided regression model demonstrates a probable positive link between likes and retweets in the dataset. The graph clearly shows that both training and testing data follow similar trends. It is also worth noting that the y-intercept is less than zero, which generally indicates that if x=0, y will still be less than zero; however, in the case of likes and replies, negative responses are not allowed. Because negative responses are not feasible when the minimum is set to zero, this emphasises the significance of analysing the model's assumptions and the accuracy of the regression. To fit the data and fulfil the requirements of linear regression, the data may need to be transformed using logarithmic or exponential transformations.\n"
