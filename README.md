## Overview
This repository contains two key Jupyter notebooks focusing on essential data science tasks using Python. These tasks include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, regression analysis, and the utilization of Python classes for data manipulation. 

## Notebooks

### Task 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis
This notebook guides through the process of preparing data for analysis and exploring datasets to uncover insights and patterns. It emphasizes the application of `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis. Instructions include the use of `pandas.DataFrame` for displaying and managing data effectively.

### Task 2: Python Classes and Regression Analysis
Building on the foundations of Task 1, this notebook introduces Python classes for structured data manipulation, followed by detailed steps for performing regression analysis. It explores the relationship between social media metrics (likes and retweets) and applies regression models to analyze trends and predictions.

## Installation and Requirements
- The notebooks are developed using standard Python packages included in the Anaconda distribution. Any additional packages used are noted at the beginning of each notebook.
- Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed, along with Jupyter Notebook to run these files.
- Specific package versions and additional installation instructions are provided within the notebooks if applicable.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and navigate to the notebook directory.
- Open the Jupyter notebooks (`CS2PP22_Assessment_task1_modified (1).ipynb` and `CS2PP22_Assessment_task2_modified.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions within each notebook to execute the tasks.
- Note: It's recommended to run the notebooks in a sequential order, especially for executing code cells that depend on previous steps.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the notebooks, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your enhancements.
